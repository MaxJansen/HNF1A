This directory is made for sumcheck.
Sumcheck takes the sum of all read counts for all genes from a given cell. (colsum of *.gene.counts.tsv).
It also takes the assigned reads from .summary files.
One would expect the colsum to be equal to the assigned reads.
The actual checking and comparing of the ratio happens locally. This directory will be used to sum the values from the 4 .gene.counts.tsv files.

The gene.counts.tsv-files that were used as input were created with a pipeline that
was tested multiple times. Sumcheck3 is the most recent one and should be used.
